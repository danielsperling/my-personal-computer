# My PC

This project aims to help new developers understand the structures that make a programming language, the way to perform control flow and also understand how computers "really" work behind the scenes.

It's very straightforward and can modified to use other programming languages as well.

## What you will see here

You will see a series of tasks you have to do in order for you computer to work. Fear not, this computer can also be extended to perform many things for you like finding and saving images, sending emails for you or ordering food. You decide where your computer goes.

These tasks will be then tested against the `RSpec` test suite, which you can call by using `rake`.


## Your first steps

Often you would see projects that offer you everything to run them, but this one is different: there are only a set of rules and you have to figure out what's missing to run the project. Check the files and find how `rake` can run.

Stuck? Your best friend is Google: e.g. `How to install the ruby ...` or `How to split arrays in ruby` are common terms you might be looking for. Keeping in mind that this is a fun pet project to elevate your knowledge and finding the answers by googling them is also part of the learning process.
